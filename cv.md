## About me

I like to write code. I understood it when I wrote my first program "Hello world!") Software ingeneering it is neverending puzzle. I like to solve problems and glad when it's done. I want to develop myself in this direction.

My first job was in road construction and it was a good experience. I learned to lead a team and find a solution to the tasks set. This experience hardened my character and gave perseverance.

When I was a student I traveled to the USA. I worked there for 5 month. This experience helped me to improve my English.

I had experience as a bartender. It helped me to improve my soft skill. I like communicate with different people with different characters. Also I can mix for you Long Island Iced Tea :)
